# World-Capital Guesser  [Play](https://acekingqueen.github.io/World-Capital-Guesser/)
This is a hangman-type game featuring dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

When the page loads, a world capital city name is generated with blanks. Use the keyboard to guess which letters are in the capital's name. 

### Win by typing each letter in the city's name. The user has 8 incorrect guesses before losing. 

I learned how to ask for help from classmates, TA's, and google making this game. I also learned that every single character in code matters. This was the first time (certainly not the last!) my code didn't work because of one letter being typed incorrectly. I think about this assignment often. 

_My biggest challenge_ was sorting out the logic of the game. Keeping score and displaying correctly guessed letters in each blank were difficult problems to solve at the beginning stages of learning JavaScript.
