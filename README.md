# World-Capital Guesser  [Play](https://acekingqueen.github.io/World-Capital-Guesser/)
This is a hangman-type game featuring dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

When the page loads, a world capital city name is generated with blanks. Use the keyboard to guess which letters are in the capital's name. 

### Win by typing each letter in the city's name. The user has 8 incorrect guesses before losing. 

_My biggest challenge_ was sorting out the logic of the game. Keeping score and displaying correctly guessed letters in each blank were difficult problems to solve at the beginning stages of learning JavaScript.

_I learned_ how to ask for help from classmates, TA's, and google.
